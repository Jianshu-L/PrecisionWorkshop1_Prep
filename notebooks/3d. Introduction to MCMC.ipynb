    "### Sampling Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation above assumes that the draws of $\\theta$ are **independent**. The limitation in using Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian inference is that it is not usually feasible to make independent draws from the posterior distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first \"MC\" in MCMC stands for **Markov chain**. A Markov chain is a **stochastic process**, an indexed set of random variables, where the value of a particular random variable in the set is dependent only on the random variable corresponding to the prevous index. This is a Markovian dependence structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Pr(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_t=x_t, X_{t-1}=x_{t-1},\\ldots,X_0=x_0) = Pr(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_t=x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This conditioning specifies that the future depends on the current state, but not past states. Thus, the Markov chain wanders about the state space, remembering only where it has just been in the last time step. The collection of transition probabilities is sometimes called a *transition matrix* when dealing with discrete states, or more generally, a *transition kernel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC allows us to generate samples from a particular posterior distribution as a Markov chain. The magic is that the resulting sample, even though it is dependent in this way, is indistinguishable from an independent sample from the true posterior."

    "## Why MCMC Works: Reversible Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chain Monte Carlo simulates a Markov chain for which some function of interest\n",
    "(*e.g.* the joint distribution of the parameters of some model) is the unique, invariant limiting distribution. An invariant distribution with respect to some Markov chain with transition kernel $Pr(y \\mid x)$ implies that:\n",

    "\\end{gathered}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariance is guaranteed for any *reversible* Markov chain. Consider a Markov chain in reverse sequence:\n",
    "$\\{\\theta^{(n)},\\theta^{(n-1)},...,\\theta^{(0)}\\}$. This sequence is still Markovian, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{gathered}\n",
    "\\begin{split}Pr(\\theta^{(k)}=y \\mid \\theta^{(k+1)}=x,\\theta^{(k+2)}=x_1,\\ldots ) = Pr(\\theta^{(k)}=y \\mid \\theta^{(k+1)}=x)\\end{split}\\notag\\\\\\begin{split}\\end{split}\\notag\\end{gathered}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward and reverse transition probabilities may be related through Bayes theorem:\n",

    "\\begin{split}\\end{split}\\notag\\end{gathered}$$\n",

    "-   $n \\rightarrow \\infty$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $\\pi^{(i)}=\\pi$ for some $i < k$\n",

    "If this chain is homogeneous it is called reversible, because it satisfies the ***detailed balance equation***:\n",

    "\n",
    "Reversibility is important because it has the effect of balancing movement through the entire state space. When a Markov chain is reversible, $\\pi$ is the unique, invariant, stationary distribution of that chain. Hence, if $\\pi$ is of interest, we need only find the reversible Markov chain for which $\\pi$ is the limiting distribution.\n",

    "## The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest and most flexible MCMC algorithms is the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. This algorithm generates candidate state transitions from an auxilliary distribution, and accepts or rejects each candidate probabilistically, according to the posterior distribution of the model.\n",

    "Let us first consider a simple Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for a single parameter, $\\theta$. We will use a standard sampling distribution, referred to as the *proposal distribution*, to produce candidate variables $q_t(\\theta^{\\prime} | \\theta)$. That is, the generated value, $\\theta^{\\prime}$, is a *possible* next value for\n",

    "\n",
    "This transition kernel implies that movement is not guaranteed at every step. It only occurs if the suggested transition is likely based on the acceptance ratio.\n",

    "\n",
    "The original form of the algorithm specified by Metropolis required that\n",

    "$\\pi(\\theta^{\\prime})/\\pi(\\theta)$, but this is not necessary. In either case, the state moves to high-density points in the distribution with high probability, and to low-density points with low probability.

    "### Random-walk Metropolis-Hastings\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm makes use of a random-walk proposal.\n",
    "Recall that a random walk is a Markov chain that evolves according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally, the density generating $\\epsilon_t$ is symmetric about zero,\n",
    "resulting in a symmetric chain. Chain symmetry implies that\n",
    "$q(\\theta^{\\prime} | \\theta^{(t)}) = q(\\theta^{(t)} | \\theta^{\\prime})$,\n",

    "\n",
    "The choice of the random walk distribution for $\\epsilon_t$ is frequently a normal or Studentâ€™s $t$ density, but it may be any distribution that generates an irreducible proposal chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consideration is the specification of the scale parameter for the random walk error distribution. Large values produce random walk steps that are highly exploratory, but tend to produce proposal values in the tails of the target distribution, potentially resulting in very small acceptance rates. Conversely, small values tend to be accepted more frequently, since they tend to produce proposals close to the current parameter value, but may result in chains that mix very slowly.\n",
    "Some simulation studies suggest optimal acceptance rates in the range of 20-50%. It is often worthwhile to optimize the proposal variance by iteratively adjusting its value, according to observed acceptance rates early in the MCMC simulation ."
